### Designed for

- Python 3.8.0
- Pygame 2.0.0.dev10

### Tested on

- MacOS 10.13.6
- Ubuntu 18.04
- Windows 10 v1909

## Try it out

Linux/MacOS:

> python main.py 'your phrase here!'

Windows:

> python main.py "your phrase here!"

### Notes

- The letters in `pixel_alphabet.png` were drawn in GIMP, and only alpha characters, period, single quote / apostraphe, space, and exclamation point are currently supported.
- The max line length is set to 8 characters; I think it's more like 6 in the actual game, but 8 allows you to say more -- beyond that though, to me, it stops feeling authentic.
- The max number of lines is currently set to 3. Again, I think you only see a max of 2 in-game.
